   <p></p><h1>MENTAL HEALTH </h1>
    
    <h2>Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well being. <br>
         It affects how we think, feel, and act, and helps determine how we handle 
         stress,relate to others, and make choices. <br>
        Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and 
        adolescence through adulthood. <br> Over the course of your life, if you 
        experience mental health problems, your thinking, mood, and behavior could be affected.

        “There is hope, even when your brain tells you there isn’t.”
        “The true definition of mental illness is when the majority of your time is spent in the past or future, but rarely living in the realism of NOW.”</h2>
